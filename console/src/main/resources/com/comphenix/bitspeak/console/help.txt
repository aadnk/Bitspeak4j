bitspeak [encode|decode] [INPUT_FILE] [-?] [-b CODEC] [-i INPUT_TEXT]
         [-o OUTPUT_PATH] [-ml SIZE] [-mw SIZE] [-ld DELIMITER] [-wd DELIMITER]
         [-sp PREDICATE]

Encode or decode the STDIN (or another source) using bitspeak, writing the
output to STDOUT or another destination.

 encode
            Encode the input bytes (STDIN) into bitspeak characters.
 decode
            Decode the input characters (STDIN) as bitspeak into bytes.
 INPUT_FILE
            Use the content of the given file as input, instead of reading
            from STDIN. For decoding, the charset is assumed to be UTF-8.
 -?, --help
            Print this help text.
 -b, --bitspeak CODEC
            Specify the CODEC used during encoding or decoding, can be either
            BS-6 or BS-8 (hyphen can be omitted). The default is BS-6.
 -i, --input-text TEXT
            Use the given TEXT as input. For decoding, the charset is assumed
            to be UTF-8.
 -o, --output-file OUTPUT_PATH
            Write the output of the encoding/decoding operation to the given
            file, instead of STDOUT.
 -ml, --max-line-size SIZE
            Set the the maximum number of characters, including delimiters, the
            encoder will output in each encoded line. This is 160 by default.
            Set to -1 for infinite.
 -mw, --max-word-size SIZE
            Set the maximum number of characters the encoder will output in a
            word. This is 8 by default. Set to -1 for infinite.
 -ld, --line-delimiter DELIMITER
            Set the delimiter to write between each outputted line.
 -wd, --world-delimiter DELIMITER
            Set the delimiter to write between each outputted word.
 -sp, --skip-predicate PREDICATE
            Specify a predicate used to match characters that will be skipped
            as whitespace during decoding.

            This is written in a form similar to a regular expression character
            class (without square brackets):
               abcA-C0-9

            Characters can be escaped using "\", using standard Java escape
            syntax. The character "-" may be escaped as well, in order to match
            it literally.
